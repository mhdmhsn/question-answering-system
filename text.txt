EDAYAR INDUSTRIAL AREA INTRODUCTION                                                             The Edayar industrial area in Kerala has turned to be a toxic hotspot due to severe pollution from the various industrial units functioning there. The area has become a dumping ground for. Edayar is a river island on the river periyar around 17 kms. The 450-acre industrial area established in 1962 falls under the Kadungalloor panchayat. The edayar has been a serious erosion in its revenue as industrial units remain closed and buildings dismantled. There are around a thousand families in and around the industrial belt. The people of   Edayar are   under trauma as the deaths due to chronic diseases continue. The Kerala High Court had suggested that the   construction of polluted industries should not be allowed in the edayar industrial area. The court made the suggestion on June 19 while considering a petition filed by Periyar Malineekarana Virudha Samithi.                                          The three integral organs of an ecological unit - the land, water and air - are polluted.  The pollutants are highly genotoxic and neurotoxic. EdayattuChal (canal), which had been the most-preferred waste dumping yard of the companies over the years. It supports the largest industrial belt in lerala with over 247 chemical industries. Most of these industries are over 50 years old and employ the most polluting of technologies .The industries taking a large amount of fresh water from the river periyar and in –turn discharge concentrated effluent with nominal treatment. This leads to large scale devastation of aquatic life in the river and the farmlands in the region. There are more than 30 effluent pipes spewing toxins into the river directly from the industry. Air emissions range from acid mist to sulphardioxide, hydrogen sulphate ,ammonia and chlorine gas.                                                                                           POLLUTION  AFFECTED AREAS                                                  The monitering agency found that the total coliform (bacteria) count exceeded the permissible limits at various sites.the wells identified for the water quality monitoring programme were located at edayar,eloor,vyttla, bhramapuram and kalamassery. the industries taking a large amount of fresh water from the river periyar and in –turn discharge concentrated effluent with nominal treatment. This leads to large scale devastation of aquatic life in the river and the farmlands in the region. There are more than 30 effluent pipes spewing toxins into the river directly from the industry. Air emissions range from acid mist to sulphar dioxide, hydrogen sulphate , ammonia and chlorine gas. The maximum total coliform count should be 50 .the total coliform count in the well located  at edayar  near the industrial area in kodungalloor panchayath was 500 per 100ml respectively against  the permitted limit. Alarming presence of heavy metals in water bodies at Edayar industrial area. The Periyar was the most polluted at six sites with high concentration of copper, arsenic, vanadium, selenium, chromium, magnesium, lithium and nickel.                                           There are 40000 people living and working on the island, 29064 of whom are the part of village community not employed by industries. There is a direct and indirect dependence on the industries of a lot of people in edayar. Study has been shown that vegitables , fruits and poultry grown on residents land in the industrially polluted edayar area have high level of pesticides and heavy metal residencies that are harmful to human health. The Chakkala thodu that falls in the industrial area is highly polluted.Organo Fertilisers, a bone processing factory, and ‘Cee Jee Lubricants’ are located the canal.                                                  A survey  identified 13 companies, including the Organo and Cee Jee, as heavy polluters. There are around 250 companies operating on either sides of the Periyar.  In a survey it has been found that almost 15 people died of cancer in the last five years.The companies are dealing with hazardous, inorganic  metallic compounds.  slaughter houses dump waste into the ‘Chakkala Thodu’ which flows through its compound. The companies should make their waste is bio-degradable which is directed to our biogas plants or make it into organic manure.  The locals were having higher tendency for developing cancer cells. This is an epidemic kind of situation and the authorities have health issues prevailing in the area immediately. The Pollution Control Board has take water samples are being analysed on a monthly basis. The companies have refuted the claims that they are the main polluting agents of the area. The Eloor-Edayar and Ambalamugal industrial belts were identified as the 24th most polluted industrial zone among the 81 clusters based on the then comprehensive environmental pollution index.                           REASONS FOR POLLUTION                                                                   High level of heavy metals is damaging the kidney, liver, muscle, tissues and gills of fish. The Kochi coastal zone is under increased industrial activity with over 250 large and medium industries causing heavy metal contamination leading to ecological decay in the region. The volume of industrial effluents discharged from the Eloor-Kalamassery industrial belt is about 260 million litres per day, much of which is directly discharged into the Periyar River from where it enters the backwaters. There is a need to study the heavy metal contamination of drinking water projects in view of the increase in renal diseases in Kerala. There have been frequent reports of Periyar turning red due to the release of industrial effluents. These effluents carry a huge quantity of  copper , zinc, lead, iron, arsenic, cadmium and other heavy metals.                                      Though the Kerala Water Authority distributes water pumped from Periyar after clarification, filtration and disinfection, experts say the process is not sufficient to remove the heavy metals. So, the authorities have to improve the treatment process and ensure the tap water is safe to drink.It is true that heavy metal contamination of drinking water can cause renal diseases. According to experts, increased presence of copper can lead to changes in haemoglobin and can be cancerous. Lead gets accumulated in the liver and kidney damaging the cells. It can affect the respiratory system and the brain cells. Zinc causes abdominal pain and vomiting.                                               The  alarming high concentration of metals like zinc, lead and copper in  which would have deleterious effects on organisms and would impose serious health issues leading to bioaccumulation and biomagnification trends. The increased heavy metal content in water has led to an abnormality of the blood cells, structural changes in the gills, liver, kidney and spleen of the aquatic organisms. The Periyar was the most polluted at six sites with high concentration of copper, arsenic, vanadium, selenium, chromium, magnesium, lithium and nickel.                                 IMPACTS OF INDUSTRIALISATION                                                 Industrialisation and development are the two parts of coin and inter related. Industrialisation is the path to be followed to attain development viz , to fashion a new socio economic and cultural order with improved human development indices. However , industrialisation alone, despite safeguards again its harmful effects on the environment, cannot guarantee the integral development of man and the environment, cannot guarantee the integral development of man and society. The aim of the study is to highlight the aftr effects of an unbalanced and frenetic industrialisation. The process of modern industrialisation in erklm district  started in ellor edayar areas.                            The environmental impacts are   Air pollution, biodiversity losses (wildlife,agro-diversity),food insecurity(crop damage),loss of landscape/aesthetic degration,soil contaimanation, waste overflow,surface water pollution /decreasing water (physio chemical,biological) quality, groundwater pollution or deplation,large scale disturbance of hydro and geological system,reduced ecological/hydrological connectivity,other environmental impacts.Health impacts are accidents,exposure to unknown or uncertain complex risks(radiation,)etc…occupational diseases and accidents,infectious diseases,death, other  environmental related diseses.socio economical impacts are loss of livelihood ,violations of human rights,loss of landscape/sense of place,other socio-economic impactsThe study focuses on the  impact of industrialisation in edayar due to as following facts:*The modern heavy and large industry of kerala was set up in this region                                                                                                         *A large no.of labours are working in these factories*A rapid growth to  this  industries*The industries has significant socio economic and cultural impact in this region*Environmental and health issues are in edayar                                                                    REMEDIES AND SUGGETIONS                               According to these the main pollution sources of concern are industries, municipal solid waste, biomedical waste, e waste and domestic waste. The action plan hence including mainly proposals for up gradation of existing pollution control facilities in the critically polluted area, common treatment facilities, common biomedical waste management facility, municipal solid waste management and e waste management.                               The short term measures proposed by the Board include industrial pollution control ,monitoring arrangement and demarcation of areas”.in a long term measures, common efficient treatment plant, common pipeline for treated efficient ,electricity supply improvement and continues monitoring of water and ambient air  quality have been suggested.*commute smart by walking or riding to work or shop instead of driving vehicles.recycling *change waste materials into new products.*reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials*reduce energy usage*reduce air pollutionreuse*reuse contributes to pollution control*conventional reuse where the item is used again for the same function*by taking useful products and exchanging them, without reprocessing ,reuse help save money, time, energy ,and resourcesWaste minimization*It is a process of elimination amount of waste produced in society*it involves redesigning products and /or changing social patterns, concerning consumption and productionEnvironmental mitigation*united state govt uses this technique and the related environmental industry*natural resources such as a stream,wetland,endangered species,archeological site or historic structure.*to “mitigate” means to make less harsh or hostilePollution prevention*pollution prevention reduces the amount of pollution generated by a process, wheather it is consumer consumption, driving or industrial production*In contrast to most pollution control strategies, the pollution prevention approach seeks to increase the efficiency of a process.*reduces the amount of pollution generated at its source                                           CONCLUSIONHuman being form only one of the species that exist in fringile and complex ecosystem  in our planet earth. The edayar industrial belt ,located on the peripheries of the erklm district ,is considered to be the industrial capital of kerala. They dumped tons of toxic chemicals, acids ,radioactive substances, metal residues and other pollutants in the environment making it  inhospitable for man, beast and plant.                                           Industrialisation of edayar created many advantages and dis advantages in society. The river periyar occupies an important role in the cultural formation and the eco system of central kerala. The present study projected the importance of safeguarding the interest of migrant labours in edayar.  govt should take constructive steps to increase employment opportunities in industries.in other side the pollution also increases .to make proper stratergies to control the pollution in edayar industrial area.
